# Banned UUIDS
A list of UUIDS that are banned from any _online_ Uncoded project.

Offline games/apps are not affected.

# How to appeal:
Most bans normally only happen if the person has done REALLY bad things, such as, but not limited to: using our services for illegal activity, stealing IDs and/or Remano Private Keys, and transferring files that contain bad things.

Therefore, the ability to appeal will most likely not show up for you. If you are banned for a set time, just wait until you are no longer banned.
(Bans that last for a period of time are not appealable. You can wait.)

However, for some cases, you are given permission to appeal. For example: a bunch of 5 year olds mass-report you for "sharing hacks for my favorite game minecraft!!1!11!1". We will *suspend* your account until further investigation is conducted (normally starts 30 minutes after suspension). 
In this scenario, you are given permission to appeal your suspension and provide evidence that you did not, indeed, share cheats for an online video game.

(You won't actually get suspended for sharing cheats. Why would we?)

# My account is "locked" or has a reason saying "2048"!
When an account is locked or has a reason that states 2048 (my favorite browser game), it doesn't mean you got banned because you didn't get to number 2048 in the game.
The main reason is normally that in Remano, you were in a chatroom/server that was doing some really shady stuff. 
If you weren't participating in it, you'll probably get your account unlocked in the next hour or so.
If you never used Remano, you were probably locked for saying really bad stuff. 
In this case, context matters. We will determine if your account should go from being locked to banned, or unlock your account.

# Will Remano private keys be banned?
Most of the time, no. Those contain personal information and will not be recorded.

*However*, if the community requests to see information about the person (let's assume they did some screwed up stuff), they will be banned on both their Remano private key AND their Uncoded Universal Key.
